A lonely “special,” a human whose mental faculties have diminished due to radiation poisoning. Isidore works for Van Ness Pet Hospital, a business that discreetly repairs electric animals for those who cannot afford living animals.
Through Mercerism, J.R. feels empathy for his fellow humans, but is at the same time excluded by his classification as a “special.”
His character is kind and sympathetic, but naive.
